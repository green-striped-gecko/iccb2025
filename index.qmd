# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

**Welcome, Trailblazers of Biodiversity, to the Second Gathering of our Population Genetics Workshop — this time under the vast skies and red dust of the Australian Outback (well… Brisbane's subtropical edge of it)!**

We’re excited to bring this workshop to the **International Congress for Conservation Biology (ICCB)** — a meeting ground where conservationists from every corner gather to share stories, science, and strategies for protecting the wild heart of our planet. While Brisbane may not boast the rustle of Kioloa’s forests, it hums with its own rhythm — a place where mangroves meet skyscrapers and river currents carry both eDNA and ideas.

In this workshop — a compact but powerful expedition — we’ll explore **Population Genetics using R**. Whether you're a seasoned fieldworker or new to the code trail, you're in good company. Here, every voice matters, and learning is a shared journey.

This is your chance to sharpen your analytical tools, exchange ideas, and delve into the genomic threads that weave through ecosystems across Australia and beyond. And yes — we’ll get our hands dirty (metaphorically… unless your dataset's really dusty) with hands-on practice using your own data.

So bring your resilience, your field-hardened humour, and your willingness to wrestle a few data-wrangling goannas. Bugs in your code? Think of them as wildlife encounters. We’ll handle it all with tenacity, teamwork, and maybe a bit of data-fuelled bush magic.

**We’re glad to have you on this journey. Let’s get started.**
