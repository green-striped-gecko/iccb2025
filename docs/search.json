    "text": "Welcome!\nWelcome, Trailblazers of Biodiversity, to the Second Gathering of our Population Genetics Workshop — this time under the vast skies and red dust of the Australian Outback (well… Brisbane’s subtropical edge of it)!\nWe’re excited to bring this workshop to the International Congress for Conservation Biology (ICCB) — a meeting ground where conservationists from every corner gather to share stories, science, and strategies for protecting the wild heart of our planet. While Brisbane may not boast the rustle of Kioloa’s forests, it hums with its own rhythm — a place where mangroves meet skyscrapers and river currents carry both eDNA and ideas.\nIn this workshop — a compact but powerful expedition — we’ll explore Population Genetics using R. Whether you’re a seasoned fieldworker or new to the code trail, you’re in good company. Here, every voice matters, and learning is a shared journey.\nThis is your chance to sharpen your analytical tools, exchange ideas, and delve into the genomic threads that weave through ecosystems across Australia and beyond. And yes — we’ll get our hands dirty (metaphorically… unless your dataset’s really dusty) with hands-on practice using your own data.\nSo bring your resilience, your field-hardened humour, and your willingness to wrestle a few data-wrangling goannas. Bugs in your code? Think of them as wildlife encounters. We’ll handle it all with tenacity, teamwork, and maybe a bit of data-fuelled bush magic.\nWe’re glad to have you on this journey. Let’s get started.",

    "text": "Elise Furlan is a Senior Research Fellow with the eDNA Team at the University of Canberra, where she applies molecular genetic techniques to tackle a wide range of ecological questions. One of the early trailblazers in Australia’s environmental DNA (eDNA) space, Elise was among the first researchers in the country to develop methods for analysing eDNA — detecting species from the tiny traces they leave behind in the environment. Her main objective is to ensure her high quality research results in applied outcomes for conservation, therefore partnerships with government agencies and industry feature heavily in her projects. session 4 and session 6\nArthur Georges, a distinguished professor at the University of Canberra, has revolutionized the understanding of sex determination in reptiles. His major achievement? Unravelling how environmental factors influence sex in reptiles, a game-changer in herpetology and conservation genetics. Arthur’s work has far-reaching implications, from conservation strategies to understanding evolutionary processes. He’s the Dumbledore of herpetology, albeit more fascinated by dragon eggs than by magic ones, and probably wonders if he could genetically engineer a lizard to brew his morning coffee. session 1 and session 4\nBernd Gruber, from the University of Canberra, is a master at blending spatial and ecological modelling with genetics. His crowning achievement? Developing dartR, a tool that’s revolutionizing genetic data analysis in conservation projects. His approach to research is as innovative as it is impactful, making him the Houdini of ecology – he makes complex data disappear into meaningful conservation strategies. Bernd might secretly wish to decode the genetic basis for why every odd sock goes missing, solving one of life’s great mysteries.session 2, session 5, and session 6\nAndrzej Kilian, founder of DArT in 2001, has been a pioneer in genomics, creating a technology that simplifies high-throughput genotyping across various organisms. His work at DArT supports global food security, sustainable agriculture, and biodiversity, making significant strides towards understanding and improving agricultural and environmental practices. Andrzej’s commitment to science and humanity illustrates a unique blend of innovation with a purpose. Andrzej, much like a maestro in an orchestra of genomes, harmonizes the complex notes of genetics to compose a symphony for a sustainable planet, ensuring every note contributes to the grander vision of global harmony and well-being. session 4\nLuis Mijangos, at DArT, he combines his passion for technology and conservation, using genetic data analysis to protect biodiversity. His standout achievement? Applying his expertise in genetic data analysis to conservation projects, making him the tech-savvy guardian of the planet. Luis’s contributions are crucial in the fight against biodiversity loss, and he’s probably brainstorming ways to use genetic data to convince plants to grow in perfect Instagram-worthy arrangements. session 2, session 3, session 4, session 5, and session 6\nDiana Robledo-Ruiz is a name you’ll want to remember in the field of conservation biology, specifically at Monash University. She’s been making waves with her work on the Helmeted Honeyeater’s genome, leading to significant advancements in genetic rescue operations. Her high-quality genomic research is not just for the birds – it’s key to saving them from extinction and maintaining their unique identity. Diana is also the lead developer of dartR.sexlinked which will make your life easier when filtering genetic data! She is developing this and other genomic tools to keep the endangered Helmeted Honeyeater, Leadbeater’s possum and Macquarie perch buzzing in the wild. session 1 and session 3\nEmily Stringer recently completed her PhD (Whooh!) at the University of Canberra, diving deep into conservation ecology and genomics. She kicked off with a mission to save the elusive Canberra grassland earless dragon and then hopped into the world of population genetics. Her main gig? Unraveling the genetic puzzle of an Australian rodent known for its dramatic population swings. Emily’s all about cracking complex data to solve ecological mysteries, aiming to turn her findings into real-world conservation victories. session 2, session 3, and session 6.

    "text": "Rationale\nWe have developed a new suit of packages called “dartRverse” packages, that will replace the previous dartR package, which soon will be no longer supported. The new suit of packages are meant to be a 1:1 replacement and only in some instance very minor changes will be needed to update previous code. For example we reworked on the “output” of all functions, now being able to save figures in specified folders, which can be easier recovered and manipulated for further tweaking. The main reasons for splitting dartR into several packages and developing the dartRverse suit of packages was difficulty to maintain dartR, because of limits imposed by CRAN, but also limits due the the long time to test new function, when compiling the package. Therefore we were forced to split the package into several smaller packages. This has several advantages and in the best of all cases no disadvantages.\n\neasier maintenance\nfaster development\nless dependencies on other packages\neasier to become a contributor\nhave your own package developed that can be branded as part of the dartRverse\n\nThe main paradigm was also that for our users nothing (or at as little as possible) needed to change and all existing code and scripts should still work. Also the installation process was meant to be straightforward and finally the coexistance between dartR and dartRverse packages should be possible (for the interim until dartR will be no longer supported).",

    "text": "Installation\n\ninstall dartRverse\n\n#installs the necessary bioconductor packages\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(\"SNPRelate\")\n\n#install dartRverse (dartRverse) & core (dartR.base, dartR.data)\ninstall.packages(\"dartRverse\")\n\nThe dartRverse package is the first package to install and its only purpose is to support the installation of the other dartRverse packages. It will also be the first port of call to provide links to tutorials and other documentation.\nIf everything works well this should install two more packages with form the core version of dartRverse, nameley dartR.base and dartR.data. Those core packages have all the main function of old dartR package that deals with input, conversion, reporting and filtering of data. Also some base function to analysse data (e.g. PCoA, Fst) are included.\nOnce the dartRverse package has been installed we can load the package to check which part of the dartRverse has been installed.\n\nlibrary(dartRverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall additional packages\nNow we can install the additional packages that are part of the dartRverse. Depending on your needs you can install all of them or only the one you are interested.\nFor example if you are interested in additional functions to analyse population structure (e.g. run STRUCTURE or faststructure) you can install the dartR.popgen package. If you are interested in functions that support the simulation of data you can install the dartR.sim package.\nYou can check which packages are avaialbel and which of them you have installed by typing:\n\ndartRverse::dartRverse_install()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe currently available packages are:\n\ndartR.sim (simulate SNP data)\ndartR.popgen (run population genetic analysis)\ndartR.spatial (run landscape genetic analysis)\ndartR.captive (estimate relatedness, support captive breeding)\ndartR.sexlinked (identify sexlinked markers, not ready yet)\n\nSo to install the dartR.sim simply type:\n\ninstall.packages(\"dartR.sim\")\ninstall.packages(\"dartR.popgen\")\ninstall.packages(\"dartR.spatial\")\ninstall.packages(\"dartR.captive\")\n# currently dartR.sexlinked requires a different installation process (see below)\n\n\n\nGithub repositories\nWe make all of our packages available via CRAN. The reason for this is that CRAN packages follow a stringent testing before they are allowed to be uploaded to CRAN and therefore are more likely to contain less errors then packages that are available on other repositories. Nevertheless we also make our packages available during development via github.\nYou can find the repositories under: https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartR.base [for the dartR.base package] and equivalent for the other packages.\nThe reason why you might want to install a package from github is that you want to use the latest version of the package. However, you should be aware that the packages on github are not tested and therefore might contain errors. Also the packages on github might be updated on a daily basis and therefore might change without notice.\nWe use different branches and they are reflecting different stages of development and majurity.\n\nmain (the main branch, which is equivalent to the current CRAN version)\ndev (development branch, which has the latest functions that might be in the next CRAN version, but have not been tested yet)\ndev_name (these are branches of our main developers and are used for testing and development of new functions. Installing functions from here might cause problems and should only be done if you know what you are doing)\n\ndartRverse supports the installation of github version of the packages using the following syntax:\ndartRverse_install(package = \"dartR.base\", repo = \"github\", branch = \"dev\")\nThis install the dev branch of dartR.base from CRAN. All main and dev branches are tested if they can be installed (and some additional error checks via): https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartRverse\nPlease note that you should provide the package repository (github/cran), the branch (main, dev,dev_name) and version number in case you want to report a bug. You can use the github methods to report issues or use our google group: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dartr.\n\n\nInstalling dartR.sexlinked\ndartRverse_install(package = \"dartR.sexlinked\", repo = \"github\", branch = \"dev\")",

    "text": "dartR Fundamentals\nJust before you get started how about checking out some prerequisite tutorials if you are not up to date. These are the following two tutorials RStudio refresher and installing dartR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso a little reminder about dartRverse:\n\n\n\nAn accessible genetic analysis platform for conservation, ecology and agriculture\ndartRverse aims to support the installation of R packages of the dartRverse that are user-friendly and deliver a variety of analyses and pipelines on the one platform. Currently there are two core R packages that need to be installed to use dartR:\n\ndartR.base\ndartR.data\n\nAdditional packages are\n\ndartR.sim (functions to simulate SNP data)\ndartR.spatial (spatial analysis)\ndartR.popgenomics (popgenomics analysis)\ndartR.captive\ndartR.sexlinked\n\ndartR is a collaboration between the University of Canberra, CSIRO and Diversity Arrays Technology, and is supported with funding from the ACT Priority Investment Program, CSIRO and the University of Canberra.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nSNPs, or single nucleotide polymorphisms, are single base pair mutations at a nuclear locus (Figure 2). That nuclear locus is represented in the dataset by two sequence tags which, at a heterozygous locus, take on two allelic states, one referred to as the reference state, the other as the alternate or SNP state.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. A diagram illustrating what is meant by a SNP (single point polymorphism)\n\n\nBecause it is extremely rare for a mutation to occur twice at the same site in the genome (perhaps with the exception of Eucalypts), the SNP data are considered to be effectively biallelic. Sites with more than two states that occur rarely are typically eliminated in the quality control steps as they are bundled with multiallelic sites arising from multiple copy sequences (e.g. as would arise from gene duplications) removed during preliminary filtering.\nThe data can be represented as SNP bases (A, T, C or G), with two states for each individual at each locus in a diploid organisms. Alternatively, because the data are biallelic, it is computationally convenient to code the data as 0 for homozyogotes for one allele, 1 for heterozygotes, and 2 for homozygotes of the other allele. The reference allele is arbitrarily taken to be the most common allele, so 0 is the score for homozygous reference, and 2 is the score for homozygous alternate or SNP state. NA indicates that the SNP could not be scored.\nSNP data when using dartR are held in a genlight object that is defined in R package adegenet (Jombart, 2008; Jombart and Ahmed, 2011). The locus metadata included in the genlight object are those provided as part of your Diversity Arrays Technology report. These metadata are obtained from the Diversity Arrays Technology csv file when it is read in to the genlight object. The locus metadata are held in an R data.frame that is associated with the SNP data as part of the genlight object.\nHere is an example of the data structure of a genlight object\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further details go check out the Data Structure tutorial.\n\n\nExample\nTo help us get our head around data interrogation, subsetting, and basic filtering we are going to work through a worked example using a test dataset.\n\n# dartR comes with a built in test dataset called testset.gl. \n# We first examine the contents of testset.gl\ntestset.gl\n\nHow many individuals have been genotyped? How many SNP loci have been scored? What is the percentage of missing data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz!\n\n\n\nThis quiz is referring to the testset.gl data set you have interrogated above.\nType the correct number into the blank boxes below:\n\nnumber of SNPs \nnumber of individuals \npercent missing data \n\nboxes will go green if you have the answer correct\n\n\n\n# Next let us copy the contents of testset.gl to another genlight object called gl.\ngl &lt;- testset.gl\n# Use adegenet accessors to interrogate the genlight object further\nnInd(gl)\nnLoc(gl)\nnPop(gl)\npopNames(gl)\nindNames(gl)\nlocNames(gl)\n\nNow you have a better appreciation of the contents of genlight object gl. pop(gl) is a vector of population names against each individual. Note that it is distinguished from popNames(gl) which just lists the unique names.\n\n# So if you want to tablulate the number of individuals in each population, use\ntable(pop(gl))\n\n\n   EmmacBrisWive    EmmacBurdMist    EmmacBurnBara    EmmacClarJack \n              10               10               11                5 \n   EmmacClarYate    EmmacCoopAvin   EmmacCoopCully    EmmacCoopEulb \n               5               10               10               10 \n  EmmacFitzAllig    EmmacJohnWari    EmmacMaclGeor    EmmacMaryBoru \n              10               10               11                6 \n   EmmacMaryPetr     EmmacMDBBowm     EmmacMDBCond     EmmacMDBCudg \n               4               10               10               10 \n    EmmacMDBForb     EmmacMDBGwyd     EmmacMDBMaci EmmacMDBMurrMung \n              11                9               10               10 \n    EmmacMDBSanf    EmmacNormJack    EmmacNormLeic    EmmacNormSalt \n              10                6                1                1 \n   EmmacRichCasi        EmmacRoss    EmmacRussEube     EmmacTweeUki \n              10               10               10               10 \n   EmsubRopeMata    EmvicVictJasp \n               5                5 \n\n\nWe have learned that typing the name of the genlight object gives its attributes. How do we examine the genotypes in a genlight object. This is done by converting it to a matrix.\n\nas.matrix(gl)[1:7,1:5]\n\nWhat do you see. Is it what you expected for the coding of the SNP scores?\nLets start again.\n\n# Copy the original testset.gl\ngl &lt;- testset.gl\n# Set the global verbosity to 3 – this will result in some detailed comments as you run each # script\ngl.set.verbosity(3)\n# Now lets use a report function to report the call rate for genlight object gl\ngl.report.callrate(gl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote that the call rate is reported against locus. This is the default. Both a tabulated result and a graph is produced. You can use both to determine a suitable threshold for filtering on callrate.\nWhat threshold do you think might be appropriate?\n\n\nNow let’s report the call rate for genlight object gl by individual.\n\ngl.report.callrate(gl,method=\"ind\")\n\nCan you see the difference. Again, both a tabulated result and a graph is produced. You can use both to determine a suitable threshold for filtering on callrate. What threshold do you think might be appropriate?\nWhat about reproducibility?\n\ngl.report.reproducibility(gl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRecall that DArT runs a series of technical replicates as part of its routine workflow. This enables an assessment of the quality of data associated with each locus. What threshold do you think might be appropriate for a filter of reproducability?\n\n\nNow let’s try some filtering. Return to call rate.\n\n# First look at a report to decide a threshold\ngl.report.callrate(gl,method=\"ind\")\n# Then filter using that threshold\ngl &lt;- gl.filter.callrate(gl, method=\"ind\", threshold=0.80)\n# Use a smear plot for a visual assessment of the effectiveness of filtering\ngl &lt;- testset.gl\ngl.smearplot(gl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNote the whitespace, which indicates missing data.\n\n\n\n# Filter on callrate by locus, then on individual\ngl &lt;- gl.filter.callrate(gl,verbose=0)\ngl &lt;- gl.filter.callrate(gl, method= \"ind\", threshold=0.80, verbose=0)\n\n# Examine the smearplot again\ngl.smearplot(gl)\n\nWhat has happened. What do you conclude?\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnock yourself out trying all the different report and filtering functions\n\n\n\nRemember to use them as pairs – report function to decide a threshold, filter function to apply the threshold (where appropriate)\nHow about trying it with a different dataset?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download SNP data (2 row)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download metadata\n\n\n\n\n# how to load a genlight object\ngl &lt;- gl.read.dart(filename=\"./data/sample_data_2Row.csv\", \n                   ind.metafile=\"./data/sample_metadata.csv\")\n\nYou can even try it with your own data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport functions\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ngl.report.callrate\nsummarises CallRate values\n\n\ngl.report.reproducibility\nsummarises repAvg (SNP) or reproducibility (SilicoDArT) values.\n\n\ngl. report.monomorphs\nprovides a count of polymorphic and monomorphic loci\n\n\ngl.report.secondaries\nprovides a count of loci that are secondaries, that is, loci that reside on the one sequence tag.\n\n\ngl.report.rdepth\nreports the estimate of average read depth for each locus\n\n\ngl.report.hamming\nreports on Hamming distances between sequence tags\n\n\ngl.report.overshoot\nreports loci for which the SNP has been trimmed along with the adaptor sequence\n\n\ngl.report.taglength\nreports a frequency tabulation of sequence tag lengths\n\n\ngl.report.sexlinked\nreports the number and type of loci likely to be in sex chromosomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter functions\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ngl.filter.callrate\nfilter out loci or individuals for which the call rate (rate of non-missing values) is less than a specified threshold, say threshold = 0.95\n\n\ngl.filter.reproducibility\nfilter out loci for which the reproducibility (strictly repeatability) is less than a specified threshold, say threshold = 0.99\n\n\ngl. filter.monomorphs\nprovides a count of polymorphic and monomorphic loci\n\n\ngl.filter.allna\nfilter out loci that are all missing values (NA)\n\n\ngl.filter.secondaries\nfilter out SNPs that share a sequence tag, except one retained at random [or the best based on reproducibility (RepAvg) and information content (AvgPIC)].\n\n\ngl.filter.rdepth\nfilter out loci with exceptionally low or high read depth (coverage)\n\n\ngl.filter.hamming\nfilter out loci that differ from each other by less than a specified number of base pairs\n\n\ngl.filter.overshoot\nfilter out loci where the SNP location lies outside the trimmed sequence tag\n\n\ngl.filter.taglength\nfilter out loci for which the tag length is less that a threshold\n\n\ngl.filter.sexlinked\nfilter out loci that are likely to be in sex chromosomes",
