# Speaker Bios {.unnumbered}

**Elise Furlan**, *bio to come...* [session 4](session04.qmd) and [session 6](session06.qmd)

**Arthur Georges**, a distinguished professor at the University of Canberra, has revolutionized the understanding of sex determination in reptiles. His major achievement? Unravelling how environmental factors influence sex in reptiles, a game-changer in herpetology and conservation genetics. Arthur's work has far-reaching implications, from conservation strategies to understanding evolutionary processes. He's the Dumbledore of herpetology, albeit more fascinated by dragon eggs than by magic ones, and probably wonders if he could genetically engineer a lizard to brew his morning coffee. [session 1](session01.qmd) and [session 4](session04.qmd)

**Bernd Gruber**, from the University of Canberra, is a master at blending spatial and ecological modelling with genetics. His crowning achievement? Developing dartR, a tool that's revolutionizing genetic data analysis in conservation projects. His approach to research is as innovative as it is impactful, making him the Houdini of ecology -- he makes complex data disappear into meaningful conservation strategies. Bernd might secretly wish to decode the genetic basis for why every odd sock goes missing, solving one of life's great mysteries.[session 2](session02.qmd), [session 5](session05.qmd), and [session 6](session06.qmd)

**Andrzej Kilian**, founder of DArT in 2001, has been a pioneer in genomics, creating a technology that simplifies high-throughput genotyping across various organisms. His work at DArT supports global food security, sustainable agriculture, and biodiversity, making significant strides towards understanding and improving agricultural and environmental practices. Andrzej's commitment to science and humanity illustrates a unique blend of innovation with a purpose. Andrzej, much like a maestro in an orchestra of genomes, harmonizes the complex notes of genetics to compose a symphony for a sustainable planet, ensuring every note contributes to the grander vision of global harmony and well-being. [session 4](session04.qmd)

**Luis Mijangos**, at DArT, he combines his passion for technology and conservation, using genetic data analysis to protect biodiversity. His standout achievement? Applying his expertise in genetic data analysis to conservation projects, making him the tech-savvy guardian of the planet. Luis's contributions are crucial in the fight against biodiversity loss, and he's probably brainstorming ways to use genetic data to convince plants to grow in perfect Instagram-worthy arrangements. [session 2](session02.qmd), [session 3](session03.qmd), [session 4](session04.qmd), [session 5](session05.qmd), and [session 6](session06.qmd)

**Diana Robledo-Ruiz** is a name you'll want to remember in the field of conservation biology, specifically at Monash University. She's been making waves with her work on the Helmeted Honeyeater's genome, leading to significant advancements in genetic rescue operations. Her high-quality genomic research is not just for the birds -- it's key to saving them from extinction and maintaining their unique identity. Diana is also the lead developer of dartR.sexlinked which will make your life easier when filtering genetic data! She is developing this and other genomic tools to keep the endangered Helmeted Honeyeater, Leadbeater's possum and Macquarie perch buzzing in the wild. [session 1](session01.qmd) and [session 3](session03.qmd)

**Emily Stringer** is rocking her PhD at the University of Canberra, diving deep into conservation ecology and genomics. She kicked off with a mission to save the elusive Canberra grassland earless dragon and then hopped into the world of population genetics. Her main gig? Unraveling the genetic puzzle of an Australian rodent known for its dramatic population swings. Emily's all about cracking complex data to solve ecological mysteries, aiming to turn her findings into real-world conservation victories. [session 2](session02.qmd), [session 3](session03.qmd), and [session 6](session06.qmd)
