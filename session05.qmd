# Assigning Individuals to Populations

*Session Presenter*

![](images/Presenters4.png)

## *Required packages*

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dartRverse)

```

## Session Content

*This is a workflow associated with Session on Population Assignment in the dartR workshop*


```{r}
# We will first set the verbosity globally to level 3
gl.set.verbosity(3)

```

```{r}
# Read in the data set for the worked example
gl <- readRDS("./data/assignment_example1.Rdata")
# Familiarize yourself with its contents
gl  
nLoc(gl)
nInd(gl)
nPop(gl)
# Display a list of populations and sample sizes
table(pop(gl))
```

::: callout-tip
##### Note that several populations have sample sizes less than 10 and will be discarded during the analysis
:::

### Analysis 1: Assignment by genotype likelihood
```{r}
gen.result<-gl.assign.on.genotype(gl, unknown="AA011731", nmin=10)

```

### Analysis 2: Assignment by Private Alleles

```{r}
pa.result <- gl.assign.pa(gl, unknown="AA011731", nmin=10, alpha=0.05)

```


### Analysis 3: Assignment by PCA

```{r}
#pca_pa_result <-gl.assign.pca(pa.result, unknown="AA011731")
```

### Analysis 4: Assignment by Mahalanobis Distances

```{r}
#mahal_result <- gl.assign.mahalanobis(pa.result,unknown="AA011731")
```


## Exercise

### The data

```{r}
gl
# The unknown
Unknown = "AA046092"
# Preliminaries
popNames(gl)

gl2 <- gl.keep.pop(gl, pop.list=c("EmsubBamuAli", "EmsubFlyGuka", "EmsubFlyJikw",
                                  "EmsubJardine", "EmsubKerema", "EmsubMorehead"))

# Knock yourself out

```
